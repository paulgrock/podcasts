I suggest skipping Gurman&#8217;s summary of the memo and scrolling down to the memo itself. Curiously, Gurman doesn&#8217;t say when the memo was posted and he omits its headline. I&#8217;ve heard the memo was posted on Monday this week, and the headline was &#8220;The Impact of Leaks&#8221;. Some observations, starting with the opening:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Last month, Apple caught and fired the employee responsible for\nleaking details from an internal, confidential meeting about\nApple’s software roadmap. Hundreds of software engineers were in\nattendance, and thousands more within the organization received\ndetails of its proceedings. One person betrayed their trust.</p>\n\n<p>The employee who leaked the meeting to a reporter later told Apple\ninvestigators that he did it because he thought he wouldn’t be\ndiscovered. But people who leak &#8212; whether they’re Apple\nemployees, contractors or suppliers &#8212; do get caught and they’re\ngetting caught faster than ever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Gurman doesn&#8217;t mention that the meeting was leaked to Gurman himself &#8212; the person who leaked <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/apple-is-said-to-push-back-some-key-iphone-software-features\">this story</a> was caught and fired. I can see why Gurman and Bloomberg might not want to emphasize that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Investments by Apple have had an enormous impact on the company’s\nability to identify and catch leakers. Just before last\nSeptember’s special event, an employee leaked a link to the gold\nmaster of iOS 11 to the press, again believing he wouldn’t be\ncaught. The unreleased OS detailed soon-to-be-announced software\nand hardware including iPhone X. Within days, the leaker was\nidentified through an internal investigation and fired.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The iOS 11 GM leak <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/09/appl-iphone-8-iphone-8-plus-iphone-x/\">revealed the name &#8220;iPhone X&#8221;</a>. It also confirmed features like Face ID and wireless charging, but the name was the big one. Face ID and wireless charging had been rumored for a year, but until that leak just three days before the event, we had no idea what Apple was going to call its new phones. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Global Security’s digital forensics also helped catch several\nemployees who were feeding confidential details about new products\nincluding iPhone X, iPad Pro and AirPods to a blogger at 9to5Mac.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear which stories at 9to5Mac this is about, but the AirPods story is probably <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2016/01/08/iphone-7-wireless-headphones-beats/\">this one</a>, which was a huge scoop published 9 months before AirPods were announced &#8212; by none other than Mark Gurman. It seems possible that every single specific example cited by Apple in this memo was someone leaking to Mark Gurman. Makes you wonder who had the balls to send this memo to him. We&#8217;ll be getting into <em>Inception</em> territory if the leaker of the memo on leakers getting fired for leaking to Gurman gets fired for leaking it to Gurman.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Leakers do not simply lose their jobs at Apple. In some cases,\nthey face jail time and massive fines for network intrusion and\ntheft of trade secrets both classified as federal crimes. In 2017,\nApple caught 29 leakers. 12 of those were arrested. Among those\nwere Apple employees, contractors and some partners in Apple’s\nsupply chain. These people not only lose their jobs, they can face\nextreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere. “The potential\ncriminal consequences of leaking are real,” says Tom Moyer of\nGlobal Security, “and that can become part of your personal and\nprofessional identity forever.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Getting fired for leaking &#8212; we all knew that happened. But this is the first I&#8217;ve heard of leakers being prosecuted criminally and going to jail. Apple is not fucking around regarding leaks.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

//           "content_html" : "\n<p>During a break in Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s testimony before Congress yesterday, Zuckerberg inexplicably left his prepared notes &#8212; PR-approved talking points for anticipated lines of questioning &#8212; behind on the table. Associated Press photographer Andrew Harnik snapped a photo of them before a Facebook aide could close them, and it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/becket/status/983846618263891968\">widely shared on Twitter</a>. The AP&#8217;s Behind the News site has <a href=\"https://blog.ap.org/behind-the-news/how-i-got-that-photo-of-zuckerbergs-notes\">a piece today on how Harnik got the shot</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once I was able to sit down at the end of the event and see the\nresponse from Twitter and read what was in Zuckerberg’s notes, I\nrealized this was pretty important information. I read some\nresponses on Twitter &#8212; the photo was congratulated and celebrated\nby many fellow journalists, while others thought it was an\ninvasion of privacy. Others simply saw the irony of someone’s\nnotes being shared so publicly during a major congressional\nhearing on data privacy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The section in the talking points that got my attention, as well as that of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaxTemkin/status/983865019136954368\">many others</a>, regarded Tim Cook and Apple. It never actually came up during his testimony, but Zuckerberg and Facebook were clearly anticipating questions pertaining to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/03/28/tim-cook-mark-zuckerberg-comments/\">Tim Cook&#8217;s recent remarks on Facebook&#8217;s business model and privacy</a>. Basically, the whole &#8220;<em>If you&#8217;re not the customer, then you&#8217;re the product</em>&#8221; argument.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the section from Zuckerberg&#8217;s notes, verbatim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tim Cook on biz model</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bezos: &#8220;Companies that work hard to charge you more and\ncompanies that work hard to charge you less.&#8221;</li>\n<li>At FB, we try hard to charge you less. In fact, we&#8217;re free.</li>\n<li>[On data, we&#8217;re similar. When you install an app on your iPhone,\nyou give it access to some information, just like when you login\nwith FB.</li>\n<li>Lots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple\nnotify people.</li>\n<li>Important to hold everyone to the same standard.]</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Zuckerberg used the first two points &#8212; citing <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/mobile/2011/09/28/amazons-bezos-we-worked-hard-to-charge-you-less-for-kindle-fire/\">Jeff Bezos&#8217;s quote about there being two types of companies</a>, and asserting that Facebook is decidedly on the &#8220;working hard to charge you less&#8221; side of that equation &#8212; when he was asked about Cook&#8217;s remarks during his (excellent) <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/4/2/17185052/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-fake-news-bots-cambridge\">podcast interview with Vox&#8217;s Ezra Klein</a> last week. The speciousness of that defense was the subject of <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/04/users_and_customers\">the column I wrote last week</a>, so I don&#8217;t need to cover it here.</p>\n\n<p>The other three points &#8212; hoo-boy. To be fair, these are only prepared notes. Zuckerberg didn&#8217;t say them, and we don&#8217;t know if he would have if questioned about Cook&#8217;s remarks. So it&#8217;s not fair to treat them as though they&#8217;re actually quotes from Zuckerberg.<sup id=\"fnr1-2018-04-11\"><a href=\"#fn1-2018-04-11\">1</a></sup> But what a pile of horseshit they would have been if he had.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On data, we&#8217;re similar. When you install an app on your iPhone,\nyou give it access to some information, just like when you login [<em>sic</em>]\nwith FB.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is almost nothing similar about how Apple and Facebook treat user data. Installing an app on an iPhone is nothing like signing in to Facebook. Yes, apps on iOS do get access to <em>some</em> data. But anything remotely private is only accessible to apps after the user has granted explicit permission for this access, and such access is also easily and clearly revokable in the Settings app&#8217;s Privacy section. Apple provides the user with clear control.</p>\n\n<p>As for where Zuckerberg might have gone with the item about &#8220;Lots of stories about apps misusing Apple data&#8221;, I&#8217;m not sure what that&#8217;s about. Maybe something like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/2/7/2782947/path-ios-app-user-information-collected-privacy\">the 2012 story where the now-nearly-forgotten app Path was caught uploading users&#8217; entire contacts database to their servers</a>? That was bad for user privacy, and Apple can be blamed for having allowed apps to access the address book without the user&#8217;s permission. But Apple responded, quickly, by making access to the address book something that required the user&#8217;s permission. (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/17/2879207/os-x-10-8-mountain-lion-privacy\">They made the same change on MacOS too</a>.) </p>\n\n<p>Apple was, at worst, naive about what apps would do with unfettered access to users&#8217; address books. Facebook is facing criticism today &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/4/10/17220060/facebook-trust-major-tech-company\">and losing its users&#8217; trust</a> &#8212; not because they&#8217;ve been naive about privacy, but because they&#8217;ve been devious about it.</p>\n\n<p>Nobody is arguing that Apple collects too much data about users. If anything, I see some people arguing the opposite: that Apple is falling behind in the machine learning race because they don&#8217;t collect and aggregate <em>enough</em> data. And as for third-party apps collecting privacy-invasive data from devices, we now know that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/03/facebook-scraped-call-text-message-data-for-years-from-android-phones/\">Facebook has been collecting phone call and SMS messaging history from Android devices</a> &#8212; but not iOS, because iOS has <em>never</em> allowed third-party apps access to phone call or text messaging data.</p>\n\n<p>Zuckerberg should stick to the &#8220;some companies work hard to charge you more, other work hard to charge you less&#8221; angle. Trying to argue that Apple is in the same boat as Facebook on the privacy front is simply laughable.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2018-04-11\">\n<p>I&#8217;m curious about the brackets that surround the last three points. (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2018/04/zuckerbergs-notes.jpg\">Close-up image</a>.) At first I thought they were typos, because they&#8217;re located within the bullet points. But I suspect the bullet points were generated by a word processor like Word or Pages, where the bullet glyphs are auto-generated by the word processor and aren&#8217;t editable. I strongly suspect that those brackets are meant to group these three points together.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2018-04-11\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "

The project, from Skydance Television,\nhas been put in development for straight-to-series\nconsideration. Deadline revealed last June that Skydance had\nmade a deal with the Asimov estate and that David S. Goyer and\nJosh Friedman were cracking the code on a sprawling series based\non the books that informed <em>Star Wars</em> and many other sci-fi\nfilms and TV series. Goyer and Friedman will be executive\nproducers and showrunners. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>Even the <em>Game of Thrones</em>&#8217; creative team would marvel at the\nnumber of empires that rise and fall in <em>Foundation</em>. Asimov’s\ntrilogy has been tried numerous times as a feature film at Fox,\nWarner Bros (with Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne, who greenlit <em>The\nLord of the Rings</em>), and then at Sony with <em>Independence Day</em>\ndirector Roland Emmerich. Many top sci-fi writers have done\nscripts and found it daunting to constrict the sprawling saga to a\nfeature film format. Most recently, HBO tried developing a series\nwith <em>Interstellar</em> co-writer and <em>Westworld</em> exec producer\nJonathan Nolan, but a script was never ordered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t read the <em>Foundation</em> series since I was a teenager, but I remember being absolutely enthralled.  A TV series is definitely the way to go with material like this. I don&#8217;t even think a trilogy of feature films could do justice to a story this sprawling &#8212; <em>Foundation</em> calls for the <a href=\"https://kottke.org/08/10/megamovies-tv-shows-as-dayslong-movies\">megamovie treatment</a>.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"http://deadline.com/2018/04/apple-isaac-asimov-foundation-tv-series-david-goyer-josh-friedman-skydance-1202361072/\">deadline.com/2018/04/apple-isaac-asimov-foundation-tv…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

It’s called the Pro\nWorkflow Team, and they haven’t talked about it publicly before\ntoday. The group is under John Ternus and works closely with the\nengineering organization. The bays that I’m taken to later to chat\nabout Final Cut Pro, for instance, are a few doors away from the\nengineers tasked with making it run great on Apple hardware. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>To do that, Ternus says, they want their architects sitting with\nreal customers to understand their actual flow and to see what\nthey’re doing in real time. The challenge with that,\nunfortunately, is that though customers are typically very\nresponsive when Apple comes calling, it’s not always easy to get\nwhat they want because they may be using proprietary content. John\nPowell, for instance, is a long-time Logic user and he’s doing the\nnew Star Wars Han Solo standalone flick. As you can imagine,\ntaking those unreleased and highly secret compositions to Apple to\nplay with on their machines can be a sticking point.</p>\n\n<p>So Apple decided to go a step further and just begin hiring these\ncreatives directly into Apple. Some of them on a contract basis\nbut many full-time, as well. These are award-winning artists and\ntechnicians that are brought in to shoot real projects (I saw a\nbunch of them walking by in Apple Park toting kit for an\non-premise outdoor shoot). They then put the hardware and software\nthrough their paces and point out sticking points that could cause\nfrustration and friction among pro users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The big news of the day is that Apple told Panzarino that the new Mac Pro will not appear until 2019 &#8212; disappointing to many, but not surprising to me. I know that many pros want Apple to simply <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/981940854381338624\">put Intel&#8217;s most powerful Xeon processors in a tower enclosure</a> and call it a day. Apple clearly has something more than that in mind, and they&#8217;re not going to tell us what that is until it&#8217;s ready.</p>\n\n<p>But this Pro Workflows Group idea is fascinating &#8212; and I&#8217;m surprised its existence never leaked. They&#8217;ve got real film editors, visual effects artists, and music producers working in house, right across the hall from the engineers working on their tools. And these groups are informing the design of the new Mac Pro (and other future pro hardware).</p>\n\n<p>Sure, I wish the new Mac Pro were coming sooner. But overall this story is fantastic news for pro users &#8212; it shows Apple not only cares about the pro market, but that they&#8217;ve changed course and decided that the best way to serve pros is to work with them hand in hand.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/apples-2019-imac-pro-will-be-shaped-by-workflows/\">techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/apples-2019-imac-pro-will-be…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Buy some Dropbox\nstorage or use Google Drive because Managed Apple ID has no way to\npurchase more iCloud storage from Apple. Looking for a Learning\nManagement System? Subscribe to an app like Showbie or SeeSaw. Do\nyou see a pattern? This isn’t to disparage any of the\nthird-parties mentioned as my school currently depends on each of\nthem to fill in the gaps that Apple won’t. However, all of those\nservices cost money and can quickly add up to a significant amount\nspent year-over-year. Don’t get me wrong. It’s great to have\nchoices in this space, but it’s hard to take Apple seriously when\nthey don’t have any first-party solutions in these areas for the\neducation market.</p>\n\n<p>By comparison, Google with Chromebooks combined with GSuite for\nEducation gives you an email account, unlimited file and media\nstorage in Google Drive, a place for hosting student created web\ncontent in Google Sites, ability to use Google Accounts as a\nsingle sign-on for various services, constantly upgraded\ncollaboration in Google Docs, Sheets and Slides and so much more\n<em>for free</em>. It’s a shame that schools that use Apple’s hardware\nneed to depend on Google’s GSuite for many of the services Apple\ndoesn’t provide.

It feels as if Apple has no desire to take care\nof the entire eco-system when it comes to education technology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a long excerpt, but Yoshinga has many other interesting observations about the state of Apple and education. But this bit above gets to the heart of it. Back in 2012 (when Apple last held an education-focused event), Apple announced new hardware and software. That&#8217;s what Apple had always done to thrive in the education market. But what Apple clearly missed then was that what educators needed were thorough device and student account management systems. Apple didn&#8217;t and still doesn&#8217;t have that. Google does.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"http://www.ohmypizza.com/2018/04/on-apple-love-letters-and-educators.php\">ohmypizza.com/2018/04/on-apple-love-letters-and-educators…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

It’s war,”\none source told me. “He gets obsessed with something, and now he’s\nobsessed with Bezos,” said another source. “Trump is like, how can\nI fuck with him?” [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>Even Trump’s allies acknowledge that much of what’s fueling\nTrump’s rage toward Amazon is that Amazon C.E.O. Jeff Bezos owns\nThe Washington Post, sources said. “Trump doesn’t like The New\nYork Times, but he reveres it because it’s his hometown paper. The\nWashington Post, he has zero respect for,” the Republican close to\nthe White House said. While the Post says that Bezos has no\ninvolvement in newsroom decisions, Trump has told advisers he\nbelieves Bezos uses the paper as a political weapon. One former\nWhite House official said Trump looks at the Post the same way he\nlooks at the National Enquirer. “When Bezos says he has no\ninvolvement, Trump doesn’t believe him. His experience is with the\nDavid Peckers of the world. Whether it’s right or wrong, he knows\nit can be done.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Josh Marshall, earlier this week, <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/mccabe-amazon-and-defending-the-republic-from-donald-trump\">in an excellent column at Talking Points Memo</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Having a sitting President launching scathing personal attacks on\na federal law enforcement officer and demanding his firing or\nimprisonment for personal and political motives is wildly outside\nthe norms that govern the American system. Similarly, a President\nwho routinely threatens prosecutorial or regulatory vengeance\nagainst private companies because they are not sufficiently\npolitically subservient to him personally is entirely outside of\nour system of governance. At present, Donald Trump is an autocrat\nwithout an autocracy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can you even imagine the reaction from Republicans if Barack Obama had gone after, say, Rupert Murdoch in this way? And of course, Trump&#8217;s main beef with Amazon, that the U.S. Post Office is losing $1.47 on every package they deliver for Amazon, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/02/donald-trump/trump-usps-postal-service-amazon-losing-fortune/\">is complete bullshit</a>. How anyone supports this president at this point is beyond my comprehension.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon&#8217;s stock is taking a hit as a result of Trump&#8217;s rhetoric, but if I were an Amazon investor, I wouldn&#8217;t worry. Jeff Bezos is very, very smart. Donald Trump is not.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/trump-war-with-amazon-and-the-washington-post-is-personal\">vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/trump-war-with-amazon-and-the…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

The strategy has\nworked with some, but is irritating others who say it is\nheavy-handed and exploits the tech giant’s clout in ways that\ncould disadvantage rivals.</p>\n\n<p>The tactic, part of the iPhone’s latest operating software\nlaunched last fall, is subtle. Users who opt not to input\ncredit-card information for Apple Pay when setting up their phones\nnow constantly see the red circle over their settings icon,\nindicating their setup is incomplete. Some users also periodically\nget notification reminders that go away only once they start the\nenrollment process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mickle has a point here. This does annoy people who, for whatever reason, don&#8217;t want to set up Apple Pay. <a href=\"https://m.imore.com/how-stop-apple-pay-pestering-you\">There is a way to dismiss the red badge</a>, but it&#8217;s not obvious how, because the button you have to tap says &#8220;Set Up Apple Pay&#8221;. (After that, you tap &#8220;Cancel&#8221; or &#8220;Set Up Later in Wallet&#8221;.) It is inscrutably counterintuitive to need to tap a button that says &#8220;Set Up Apple Pay&#8221; when your intention is to stop being nagged to set it up because you <em>don&#8217;t want to set up Apple Pay</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But the Journal article never explains that you can turn off this red badge. As Mickle tells it, the only way to turn off the badge is to sign up for Apple Pay. That&#8217;s just wrong, and renders the remainder of his article moot.</p>\n\n<p>In act 2, the article turns weird:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Though payment analysts say the service speeds up checkout times\nand is more secure than traditional cards, Apple Pay has struggled\nto earn broad adoption in the U.S. Many remain skeptical that it\nis more secure, including Jack Frederick, a 29-year-old\nprofessional comedian from Queens, N.Y., who prefers using his\ncredit card directly.</p>\n\n<p>“This is the most aggressive they’ve ever been,” said Mr.\nFrederick, who has had a red badge over his iPhone settings since\nupdating his software in mid-January. He said the notification has\nmade him consider trading his iPhone 6 for a Google Pixel. “All\nthat from one dot,” he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Experts say using Apple Pay is faster and more secure than using a credit card, but here&#8217;s a 29-year-old comedian who thinks otherwise. Who wouldn&#8217;t take credit card security advice from a completely random guy on the street?</p>\n\n<p>I do think Apple has a marketing problem with Apple Pay, though. I can tell from talking to family members that a lot of people just don&#8217;t see why they should try Apple Pay, because they have no idea how it works or why they&#8217;d want to use it. And I think they worry that because it&#8217;s new and sort of science-fiction-y it will make their credit card <em>more</em> likely to be hacked, when the truth is the opposite. I think Apple needs more ads that explain and demonstrate the convenience and indisputable security advantages of using Apple Pay instead of a credit card, and the extraordinary convenience of Apple Pay Cash. I can see how a lot of people think, &#8220;<em>Eh, I&#8217;ll just keep using my credit card</em>&#8221; when they&#8217;re paying for something in a retail store. But Apple Pay Cash could be enough to get these people to set up Apple Pay.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, in act three, Mickle takes things to the absurd:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Everyone is doing essentially the same trick,” said Roger Kay, an\nanalyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates. “It’s really\nantitrust behavior.”</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Kay compared Apple Pay setup badges and notifications to\nMicrosoft Corp. bundling its Internet Explorer browser with\nWindows in the 1990s &#8212; a strategy the Justice Department\nsuccessfully sued to stop on antitrust grounds saying it hurt\nrivals. “They used to have actual behavioral remedies and say you\ncan’t do this,” Mr. Kay said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a ridiculous comparison in several ways, but I&#8217;ll point out just one. With the benefit of 20 years of hindsight, it&#8217;s now clear that one aspect of Microsoft&#8217;s defense was correct: web browsers do belong built into operating systems at the system level. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2018/04/safari-required.png\">Good luck removing Safari</a> from MacOS or iOS. I wish you even better luck removing Chrome from a Chromebook.</p>\n\n<p>Netscape didn&#8217;t lose to IE because IE was built into Windows; it lost because IE was better. And when first Firefox and then Chrome came along, they thrived on Windows because they were better than IE.</p>\n\n<p>Apple Pay, as conceived, has to be built into the OS. By Kay&#8217;s argument, most of the built-in features in <em>any</em> OS are anticompetitive. What new features <em>could</em> be added to iOS without hurting some sort of <a href=\"https://justgetflux.com/ios.html\">competitor</a>?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple declined to comment on potential antitrust concerns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Probably because they were stifling laughter.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

//           "content_html" : "\n<p>Fascinating, wide-ranging podcast interview (with an excellent transcript) <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/4/2/17185052/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-fake-news-bots-cambridge\">between Vox&#8217;s Ezra Klein and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Klein</strong>: One of the things that has been coming up a lot in the\nconversation is whether the business model of monetizing user\nattention is what is letting in a lot of these problems. Tim Cook,\nthe CEO of Apple, gave an interview the other day and he was asked\nwhat he would do if he was in your shoes. He said, “I wouldn’t be\nin this situation,” and argued that Apple sells products to users,\nit doesn’t sell users to advertisers, and so it’s a sounder\nbusiness model that doesn’t open itself to these problems.</p>\n\n<p>Do you think part of the problem here is the business model where\nattention ends up dominating above all else, and so anything that\ncan engage has powerful value within the ecosystem?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Zuckerberg</strong>: You know, I find that argument, that if you’re not\npaying that somehow we can’t care about you, to be extremely glib\nand not at all aligned with the truth. The reality here is that if\nyou want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the\nworld, then there are a lot of people who can’t afford to pay. And\ntherefore, as with a lot of media, having an advertising-supported\nmodel is the only rational model that can support building this\nservice to reach people. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>But if you want to build a service which is not just serving rich\npeople, then you need to have something that people can afford. I\nthought Jeff Bezos had an excellent saying on this in one of his\nKindle launches a number of years back. He said, “There are\ncompanies that work hard to charge you more, and there are\ncompanies that work hard to charge you less.” And at Facebook, we\nare squarely in the camp of the companies that work hard to charge\nyou less and provide a free service that everyone can use.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t think at all that that means that we don’t care about\npeople. To the contrary, I think it’s important that we don’t all\nget Stockholm syndrome and let the companies that work hard to\ncharge you more convince you that they actually care more about\nyou. Because that sounds ridiculous to me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is certainly something to Zuckerberg&#8217;s argument here, but the speciousness of the way he formulates it is that a company working hard to charge you more money <em>is</em> undeniably incentivized to care more about you, <em>if</em> you can afford their product or service. I think it’s undeniable that Apple cares more about the hundreds of millions of people who buy its products than Facebook cares about any of its billions of users.</p>\n\n<p>The more apt Tim Cook quote that applies here <a href=\"https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/tim-cook-to-google-users-youre-not-the-customer-youre-the-product-594242\">is this long-standing internet adage</a>: &#8220;When an online service is free, you&#8217;re not the customer. You&#8217;re the product.&#8221; Amazon is undeniably focused on low prices. But Facebook doesn&#8217;t charge low prices &#8212; they charge high prices. To their customers: advertisers. And <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/234056/facebooks-average-advertising-revenue-per-user/\">a cursory look at their financials</a> indicates they&#8217;ve been working hard to raise those prices.</p>\n\n<p>The linguistic trick Zuckerberg pulls here is that nowhere in the entire interview does he mention the words <em>user</em> or <em>customer</em>. He only says <em>you</em> (in the plural sense) and <em>people</em>. That&#8217;s a dodge, because unlike Apple &#8212; and Amazon &#8212; Facebook&#8217;s users are not its customers &#8212; and most of the controversies they are dealing with today all stem from the fact that they favored their customers (advertisers willing to pay ever-higher sums for ever-more-invasively-targeted ads) at the expense of their users.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

Back in 2016, SamMobile ran a piece headlined &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.sammobile.com/2016/12/06/exclusive-galaxy-s8-is-not-going-to-feature-a-3-5mm-headphone-jack/\">Galaxy S8 Is Not Going to Feature a Headphone Jack</a>&#8221;. That report was wrong &#8212; and not only did the Galaxy S8 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus\">retain a standard headphone jack</a>, the new Galaxy S9 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17093588/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-phone-review\">does too</a>. (Badly <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/difference-apple-samsung-industrial-design\">misaligned with the other outputs on the bottom of the phone</a>, natch.)</p>\n\n<p>But I was wrong too. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/12/06/samsung-jack-off\">I read the SamMobile report and predicted it was correct</a>, simply on the grounds that Samsung inevitably follows Apple&#8217;s lead on initially contentious design decisions. Remember removable batteries? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hIoyb9L5g0\">Samsung was still touting them</a> as an advantage as recently as 2015.</p>\n\n<p>I remain convinced that traditional headphone jacks are going the way of the floppy drive, and that sooner or later, they&#8217;ll be gone from all new phones. But maybe that&#8217;ll be a bit later rather than sooner.</p>\n\n<p>I think there are two factors in Apple&#8217;s advantage here: Apple&#8217;s W1 chip and Lightning.</p>\n\n<p>The real future of consumer headphones is wireless. There are plenty of standard Bluetooth headphones on the market, and they are getting better every year. I recently bought a pair of <a href=\"https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html\">Bose QuietComfort 35</a> headphones for use on airplanes, and I like them a lot &#8212; they sound good, the noise cancellation is excellent, battery life is good, and latency is negligible. The pairing process is OK, but still lags far behind the ease of pairing AirPods with an iOS device. But good Bluetooth headphones are expensive &#8212; my QuietComfort 35s cost $350. (Beats makes noise-cancelling headphones with the W1 chip at pretty much the same prices as Bose, but <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-headphones/\">head-to-head reviews suggest</a> the QuietComforts are more comfortable and Bose&#8217;s noise cancellation remains noticeably superior. For use on an airplane, comfort and noise cancellation are paramount.)</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line, there&#8217;s nothing quite like AirPods for Android devices, and that matters. It&#8217;s no coincidence that Apple didn&#8217;t remove the headphone jack from the iPhone until they had the AirPods to announce together.</p>\n\n<p>But I think the bigger factor is that Lightning makes for a better wired headphone jack than USB-C. The future is wireless, but the present remains tethered. Ever since the iPhone 7, Apple has shipped a pair of Lightning EarPods in the box, along with a 3.5mm to Lightning adapter. Apple&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMTN2AM/A/earpods-with-lightning-connector\">Lightning EarPods cost $29</a>, just like Apple&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-with-35-mm-headphone-plug\">EarPods with a standard headphone plug</a>. They&#8217;re cheap enough for Apple to include in the box with every iPhone, and no more expensive than previously for customers to replace.</p>\n\n<p>USB-C headphones, on the other hand, seem to be a mess. Helen Havlak wrote a piece for The Verge a few months ago titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/10/16633516/google-pixel-2-earbuds-dongle-xiaomi-usb-c-price\">Buying USB-C Earbuds for My Pixel 2 Was Incredibly Annoying and Expensive</a>&#8221;:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two weeks after starting my cheap Pixel 2 earbud search, I finally\nhave a working pair &#8212; but they cost almost twice the amount I\nwanted to spend, and don’t feel very premium. If I lose or break\nthem, it’ll cost me almost $50 and another 10-day wait. The next\ntime I upgrade my phone, they may not be compatible. Even the\nApple Store sells $29 Lightning EarPods. Google needs to do a lot\nbetter by its Pixel owners than a single $149 USB-C option. Even\nbetter, just give us back the damn headphone jack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The headphone situation with Google&#8217;s Pixel 2 is more confusing than I expected. <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/headphones/google-pixel-2-headphone-conundrum-usb-c-digital-audio/\">Nicholas Deleon, writing for Consumer Reports</a>, explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In an online post, Google noted that only headphones compatible\nwith USB Type-C Digital Audio will work with the Pixel 2. [&#8230;]\nAnalog Type-C headphones won’t produce any sound, Google says.\nInstead they will prompt a smartphone notification informing you\nthat you need different headphones. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>How do I know whether my headphones are compatible?</p>\n\n<p>For now, Google recommends that you purchase headphones certified\nas “Made for Google.” This program, similar to Apple’s “Made for\niPhone” program, confirms that the hardware is fully compatible\nwith the Pixel 2. As of now, only three manufacturers offer\nheadphones that have earned that distinction: AiAiAi, Master &amp;\nDynamic, and Libratone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not exactly the three biggest brand names in the audio world.</p>\n\n<p>So the gist of it is that it&#8217;s not enough to have USB-C headphones. Pixel owners need the <em>right kind</em> of USB-C headphones &#8212; only those that support digital audio, and they seem to be far from common today. And the ones that do exist seem to be quite expensive. The cheapest Pixel-compatible USB-C headphones in Google&#8217;s store <a href=\"https://store.google.com/category/headphones\">are the Libratone Q Adapt earphones</a>, and they cost $149. That&#8217;s a lot more than $29, and a lot of money for headphones from a brand I&#8217;ve never heard of. They&#8217;re also the only earbud-style USB-C headphones Google offers. The even more goofily-named <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/aiaiai_tma_2_headphones\">Aiaiai TMA-2 MFG4 on-ear headphones</a> cost $180.</p>\n\n<p>So with the Pixel, the recommended options start at $149, and the unrecommended options &#8212; as explored by Havlak <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/10/16633516/google-pixel-2-earbuds-dongle-xiaomi-usb-c-price\">in her aforelinked Verge piece</a> &#8212; cost about $50 and are of questionable quality. No wonder Google didn&#8217;t include earbuds in the box with the Pixel 2. (<a href=\"https://support.essential.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015627107-What-comes-with-the-Essential-Phone-\">Essential doesn&#8217;t either</a>, and they charge <a href=\"https://shop.essential.com/products/earphones-hd\">$99 for their earbuds</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Samsung is more of a &#8220;<em>do what the customer is asking for</em>&#8221; company; Apple is a &#8220;<em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/988332-some-people-say-give-the-customers-what-they-want-but\">figure out what they&#8217;re going to want</a></em>&#8221; company. Samsung&#8217;s customers aren&#8217;t asking for the headphone jack to be dropped, so the path of least resistance is to just keep the jack. But looking at what&#8217;s available on the market, a big problem facing Samsung (and the rest of the Android world) is that the USB-C headphone market is a mess &#8212; and expensive to boot. &#8220;No-name brand headphones at high prices&#8221; is a hard sell.</p>\n\n<p>As much as AirPods are better (and cheaper) than standard Bluetooth earbuds, there is seemingly nothing <em>close</em> to Lightning EarPods on the market for USB-C. AirPods get all the attention, but Lightning EarPods are even further ahead of their USB-C competition. The proprietary nature of Lightning allowed Apple to make sure it was ready to serve as the wired audio connector for iPhones when Apple wanted it to be. Keep that in mind the next time you wonder why Apple doesn&#8217;t drop Lightning for USB-C.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

It encapsulates many of the themes I&#8217;ve written about regarding Apple from the beginning. Five years seems like a good time to revisit it, and I have to say my argument holds up pretty well.</p>\n\n<p>To pick just one example, Wu&#8217;s theory involved a cockamamie ranking system he invented in which he assigned companies an &#8220;openness&#8221; score, and he alleged that these scores roughly tracked the market caps of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and post-Jobs Apple. I called nonsense on the whole premise that market cap correlates to openness (I called nonsense on just about every point Wu made, really), and pointed out that while Apple indeed suffered a stock price dip in 2013 (that was around the time when there was a popular theory that Samsung was eating Apple&#8217;s lunch in the phone market), Apple&#8217;s stock price at the beginning of March 2013 was <em>still</em> higher than it was when Steve Jobs died.</p>\n\n<p>Today, five years to the day after I wrote that, Apple&#8217;s stock price <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=aapl+march+1+2013+to+march+2+2018\">is up 185 percent</a> &#8212; it&#8217;s trading at nearly 3× the price from March 2013.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I think it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2013/03/open_and_shut\">well worth a re-read</a>. It even has an inline image, which is somewhat rare.</p>\n\n\n\n    "
